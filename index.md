【正念的态度基础】
当你开始想让正念
When you set about bringing mindfulness
以一种自律的方式进入你的生活
in some kind of disciplined way into your life as a love affair
随着生命的本身展开
with the unfolding of life itself,
并试着  让自己不遗漏那些时刻
and an experiment in making sure you're not missing
或者 不再穿梭于过去的记忆
your moments, or driving through your moments
或者 让自己停止被卷入某些反应中
to get the better moments, or constantly caught up
记住某些要点是很有帮助的
in reactivity, it's helpful to keep certain elements in mind.
有时这些因素
So these factors that are sometimes
被称为 态度因素  真的
called attitudinal factors, they really
它们为你的入座
set the stage for taking your seat,
或者在当前时刻表明立场  做好了准备
or taking a stand in the present moment.
所以  在某种意义上  它们确实完善了这个修习
So they, in some sense, really round out the practice
并且成为了这个修习的必要条件
and are essential to the practice.
不是说你要强迫自己遵守这些要点
They are not things that you force on yourself,
而是说  你只需要记住它们即可
but rather that you just keep in mind, so to speak.
或者更合适的说法是
Or maybe it would be even more appropriate to say,
将它们放在心里
keep in heart.
【不作评判】
第一点是不作评判
So the first of these is non-judging.
就像我之前说的  不作评判并不意味着
And as I've said, non-judging does not
你不会对其他事评头论足
mean that you won't be judging.
这意味着在某种意义上
It means that in some sense you'll
你会真正注意到  你  我  我们所有人
become really mindful of how judging you,
都一直不停地在评判
and I, and all of us are constantly.
但我们不会对这个想法妄加评判
And we won't judge that judging.
而是觉察到  这种评判
But the awareness of the judging and the intention
并且不陷入评判中
to not be caught by it is in itself
这样就是一种美丽而又温柔的修习
a kind of beautiful and very gentle
从某种意义上说  这种修习是让你去足够关心自己
practice of, in some sense, caring enough about yourself
以及你自己所处的环境
and whatever circumstances you find yourself
让你不会有那种瞬间崩溃
in to not immediately collapse and contract
也不会拘泥于喜欢或不喜欢  想要或不想要
around liking and disliking, wanting or not wanting, pushing
推开或接近
away or driving towards.
因为真的归根结底  我们被囚禁在自己评判中
Because really we are prisoners of our own judgments
因为它减少了
when it comes down to it, because it reduces
我们应对挑战的可能性
our possibilities for responding to challenging situations,
而不是无意识地  几乎习惯性地做出反应
instead of reacting mindlessly, more or less, habitually
每次有事情发生的时候
every time certain things come up,
我们会困在一个观点中
and we contract into a view that may not
可能并不是一个完整的故事  完整的视角
be the whole story, the whole view.
这实际上是冥想修习的核心
So this is actually the heart of meditative practice.
这是一个基本的——
And this is a fundamental--
我甚至不想称它为一种技能  因为如果那样说
I don't even want to call it a skill, because then it
听起来就太平淡无奇了
just sounds too pedestrian or mundane.
这是一场冒险
It's an adventure.
是在冒险着去做到
It's part of the adventure of seeing
不被自己喜欢和厌恶所禁锢
that we don't have to be imprisoned by our own likes and dislikes.
事实上  我们可以把自己
And, in fact, that we can liberate ourselves
从下意识去评判“好”与“恶”  这个习惯中解救出来
from our unconscious attachment to our likes and dislikes,
从自己的欲望和恐惧中解救出来
and our wants and our fears.
然后就可以无缝地融为一个整体
And this then just seamlessly integrates, as
融合所有这些因素  以及更多其他因素
do all these other factors, and many more besides,
变成这个修习本身
into the practice itself.
【耐心】
第二个态度因素
And the second of these attitudinal factors,
会在生活中  兵荒马乱的时刻展开
as they're unfolded in full catastrophe living at least,
那就是耐心的品质
is the quality of patience.
即使这只是在心中的一种可能性  保持耐心的美在于
And the beauty of keeping patience even as a possibility
不是某种理想状态  而是一种可能性
in mind, not some kind of ideal, but just the possibility
我们会立刻意识到自己是多么的不耐烦
in mind is that we immediately become aware of how impatient
以及我们有时候  是多么的想要得到一个最终的结果
we are, and how at times we want to get to an end result,
不管与结果之间有什么障碍  我们想方设法地去达到目的
and will drive through whatever is between us and that end
所以我们像是在强迫自己挣脱现在
result. And so we're kind of forcing ourselves to get out
然后期待着在未来
of the present moment because we're anticipating some better
有更好的当下
present moment in the future.
从某种意义上说  这是不明智的
And this is, in some sense, unwise
有时会造成伤害  因为你身边的人
and creates damage sometimes, because other people have
也要和你的急躁一起生活
to live with your impatience.
有时你的不耐心  会有攻击性的成分
And it has an aggressive element to it sometimes.
比如说  通常来讲  我们失去耐心的时候
The victims, let's say, of our impatience
受害者往往是与我们生活在一起的人
are often the people that we live with and love
我们最爱的人  还有我们一起工作的人
the most, or people that we work with, and might actually
在某种意义上  如果要节制我们的不耐烦
feel that a steady diet of my impatience is, in some sense,
那不是在虐待自己  就是完全忽视自己的感受
really disregarding, if not abusive.
所以不是说
So impatience isn't just something
你感知到不耐心  开始培养自己的耐心时
that you benefit from recognizing
只有你自己从中受益
and then cultivating patience in yourself.
你周围的人也会从中
But other people around you will benefit from it
受益巨大
enormously as well.
这并不意味着你必须满足于现状
Now, it doesn't mean you have to be satisfied with things as they are.
当然了  我们都希望朝着某个方向改变
Of course, we all want change in a direction
一个真正转变的  有益的  治愈的方向
that's truly transformational, beneficial, and healing.
但正如禅语所说  不能逆势而为
But as the old zen sayings goes, you can't push the river.
逼让自己加快脚步到达某个地方是不明智的
And it's unwise to kind of hurry yourself up to get someplace,
你会忘记到了那之后
and thereby forget that there's
其实你就会无处可去  无事可做
no place to go, nothing to do, and no special something
那里也没有什么特别的
that we're after.
所以耐心是我们可以培养的一种品质
So a patience as a quality that we could cultivate
特别是在我们当下这个时代  它越来越重要了
is even more important now as we move deeper and deeper
我们在这个电子信息时代  被电子产品吸引
into the digital world than our seductions and addictions
对其上瘾
around our devices.
所以我们社会就变成了
And so we have become a kind of click
点击型社会
attached society, where everything
在我们的手机或笔记本电脑上呈现的所有东西
that's presented to us on our phones or on our laptops
经常被称为“标题党”
is often what's described as clickbait.
它通过媒介找到你
It's out there hunting for you, looking
给你想要的东西
for you to want something.
脸书上的那种标题党和点赞
That kind of clickbait and likes on Facebook
这些实际上触发了你大脑中神经元的连接
and things like that actually trigger neuronal connections
刺激多巴胺的释放
in the brain that stimulate the release of dopamine,
这一瞬间会给人一种非常非常满足的感觉
which generates a very, very satisfying feeling for one instant.
你会得到多巴胺带来的满足感
That you get this dopamine hit of satisfaction
仅仅是因为有人在脸书上给了我一个大拇指
because somebody gave me a thumbs up on Facebook,
脸书上的点赞
a like on Facebook.
噢  是我说了这些话  然后别人就很喜欢
And ah, I said something, and someone else liked it.
但这只持续了不到一秒
And that lasts a fraction of a second,
那种满足感
that feeling of satisfaction.
那种满足感
that feeling of satisfaction.
然后你猜怎么着
And then guess what.
我们会想要更多
We want more.
哎  只有一个人喜欢它
Only one person liked it.
然后我们开始观察社交媒体的生态
And we start to sort of survey the landscape.
然后我们不仅变得不耐烦
And then we get seriously not only impatient,
而且也是上瘾的一个表现
but it's an element of actually addiction
我们可能都没有意识到
that we may not be aware of.
所以耐心实际上培养了一种
So patience actually cultivates a certain kind
对这种事的免疫力
of immunity to this kind of thing,
因为你意识到那种
because you recognize the impulse
想要得到什么的冲动
to actually want to get something else.
然后你可以让自己慢下来
And you can slow yourself down.
所以在一整天里
So throughout the course of the day
不断觉察到我们有多么不耐烦
mindfulness of how impatient we are actually
这便能帮助我们培养耐心
helps us to cultivate its opposite.
所以说  你不用强迫自己
So you're not trying to force yourself
在某些情况下一定要有耐心
to be patient under certain circumstances.
但我们要更愿意去关注那些
But more we're willing to look at those moments
我们真的陷进去的时刻
where we really get caught, and we really
真的陷入了那种 不断加速
fall into our own kind of constantly accelerating
想要去得到某个结果  然后引发出一系列
intention to get some result that then leads
下一个结果  下一个  再下一个
to the next result, the next result, and the next result,
然后我们再也无法满足
and we're never actually satisfied.
这在静坐冥想中非常重要
This will all become extremely important in sitting.
因为静坐冥想的有趣之处
Because the interesting thing about sitting
或任何其他形式冥想的有趣之处
meditation or any other form of meditation
在于  你要真的带着心灵来冥想
is that you actually bring your mind with you.
坐下来时  你可以怀着各种意图和想法：
And so you sit down with every intention
当一个平静  快乐  有洞察力的人
to be like a calm, happy, sort of deeply insightful person.
然后有一些事物开始出现了
And then this stuff starts to happen
就好像你的手机
almost as if you have your phone in there
正在你的大脑里面一样
with you in your brain.
事情一件接着一件向你涌来
And it's one thing after another.
你可能会被诱惑  就像我们之前感受到的那样
And you can get seduced by that, as we've been seeing.
然后  你可以透过耐心这个镜头
And here again, patience would be one lens
去看心中的所有事情
that you could bring to this there are many others
耐心会提醒你  嘿  慢点
that would remind you to, hey, slow down.
你不需要去别的地方
You don't actually need to get anywhere else.
你不需要去别的地方
You don't actually need to get anywhere else.
事实上  我们在这里培养的恰恰相反
In fact, the exact opposite is what we're cultivating here.
这是在跟你自己说
How about at least reminding yourself
你到这里就已经很宝贵了  因为你已经抵达这里了
that it might be valuable to be here, since you already are.
【初学者心态】
另一个正念的态度因素
Another factor attitudinal factor of mindfulness
是铃木俊隆  这位伟大的日本禅师
is what Suzuki Roshi, this wonderful Japanese zen master,
也就是他
one of the major people responsible for bringing
把禅宗传统带到了美国
the Chan zen tradition to America,
他说过一句很有名的话  “初学者的心
is famous for having said, in the beginner's mind there
充满可能性
are many possibilities.
而在专家头脑里  可能性并不多”
In the expert's mind, there are few.
我们需要去培养这种初学者的心态
We really need to cultivate beginner's mind
因为在某种意义上  我们所知道的一切
because everything that we know, in some sense,
不管是在各个领域中成为专家 还是什么
being a big expert about every subject
都会妨碍我们看到那里的一些东西
whatsoever actually prevents us from seeing what's here,
因为我们是在透过我们的有色眼镜看面前的东西
because we already see it through our lenses of,
我知道那是什么
I know what that is.
我知道那是什么
I know what that is.
我知道那是什么
I know what that is.
我充分了解
I get that.
我什么都知道
I know who that is.
实际上  你可能不知道
And actually, you may not.
这些只是你的推测或想法
Those are just your projections or your thoughts,
或者你固定的思维结构
or your constructions, mind constructions,
自己的叙事
narrative stories.
我们自己会不断地产生很多故事
We're just continually generating
全都围绕着  “我”这个人称
stories centered around, guess who, the personal pronoun I,
“我”  “我所知道的”  “我所理解的”  “我所喜欢的”
me, and what I know, and what I understand, and what I like,
还有“我不喜欢的”
and what I don't like.
所以初学者的心态是在提醒你
So beginner's mind is just reminding you,
嘿  冷静点
hey, chill out a bit.
我其实不知道这么多
Don't know so much.
你其实并不如你想象中的那么了解
You don't actually know as much as you think.
也许你知道各种各样的
And maybe you know all sorts of things
你以为自己不知道的事情
that you have no idea that you know because you're thinking
因为你的想法支配着你天生智力的其他方面
is dominating other aspects of your native intelligences,
很多很多方面
of which there are many.
所以  初学者的心态是美好的
So beginner's mind is just a beautiful thing
所以  初学者的心态是美好的
So beginner's mind is just a beautiful thing
要时常记在心里
to keep in mind from time to time.
每次你坐下来  就像是  第一次入门
Every time you take your seat it's like, for the first time
不是说  看啊  现在
it's like not, oh, now the big expert
这位大专家坐在了冥想垫上
is taking his or her seat on the meditation cushion
我知道冥想是什么
and I know what this meditation is all about.
但其实  你知道什么呢
And it's like, you don't know anything.
谁敢说自己知道呢?
And who is even claiming to know that?
所以初学者的心态更像是  不觉的心态
So beginner's mind is more like don't know mind.
韩国禅师崇山行愿
Seung Sahn, this Korean zen master
教我这么修习
taught this what am I practice.
他是这样教的
And he taught it in the following way.
这和初学者心态非常相似
And this is really very akin to beginner's mind.
他会坐直
So he'd sit up straight.
脸上露出疑惑的表情
And he's get a quizzical look on his face,
他会说
and he'd say,
我是什么啊?
what am I?
他把这个表演出来了
And he's acting this out.
他说  你就该这么修习
He's like saying, this is the way you should practice.
我是什么啊?
What am I?
然后他的脸上就会出现一种更奇怪的表情
And then he'd get an even more quizzical look on his face
然后他的脸上就会出现一种更奇怪的表情
And then he'd get an even more quizzical look on his face
他把头歪向一边  仿佛在思考这个问题
and tilt his head a certain way, as if he was thinking about it,
其实他这么做是在戏弄我们
which he's teasing us as he's doing this.
然后他会说  不知道啊
And he'd say, don't know.
不知道啊
Don't know.
然后他会说  你保持着这个不知道
And then he would say, you keep this don't know.
保持这个不觉心态
Keep this don't know mind.
那么  任何伟大的科学家  任何称职的科学家都知道
Now, any great scientist, any scientist worth her salt
原有的知识结构  可能会演变为严重的问题
knows that what you know can be seriously problematic
因为它会限定你
because it can actually anchor you
让你在已知的领域中
to the known in a way that becomes blinding
对那些新兴未知的苗头视而不见
to what is just over the horizon in the not known,
而那才是你想要发现的  全新的
that you want to discover the new,
前所未见的东西
something nobody's seen before.
有时  我们的想法和观点
And sometimes our ideas and opinions
都可以禁锢我们  或者说成为专家
can actually be imprisoning, or we become experts,
知道的太多了  都会限制我们
and we know too much.
经常会有人因为一些深刻的发现
And very often someone will win the Nobel Prize
获得了诺贝尔奖
for some profoundly insightful discovery.
然后这个领域里的其他人可能会说
And there were always people around who
哎  我怎么没想到这点呢?
say, why didn't I see that?
就在他获奖之后
After the fact.
这是一个很有趣的问题  你可以问问自己
And it's a really interesting question to ask yourself,
因为有时候这些东西  可能并不细小
because sometimes these things, while they're not trivial
可能还很明显  这种洞察力
or just totally obvious, they actually may be these kinds
反而在我们不知道这么多的时候  可能会更容易理解
of insights, might be more accessible if we don't know
如果我们能摆脱
so much, if we get out from under the weight
“我肯定知道”  “我懂”   这种压力
of our knowing, knowing, knowing,
摆脱自己编造的故事和想法
and the stories and constructs we build that prevent us from
这些往往会阻止我们去看到“小孔”
seeing the holes, H-O-L-E-S, the places where like maybe
就好像这里有个弯  或者是盔甲上的裂缝
there's a kink here or a chink in the armor.
而我们不知道这是什么
And we don't know what this is.
所以  所有伟大的科学家都知道“不觉”的力量
So all great scientists know the power of not knowing.
初学者的心态是绝对有必要的
But the beginner's mind is absolutely essential,
不仅仅是在科学发现或艺术表现上
not just in scientific discovery or in artistic expression,
不仅仅是在科学发现或艺术表现上
not just in scientific discovery or in artistic expression,
还有在日常生活中  在家庭中
but in the actual unfolding of everyday life, in the family,
工作的时候  冥想的时候  都很重要
at work, and on your meditation cushion.
【信任】
另一个态度基础是  信任
Another of these attitudinal foundations is trust.
相信什么?
Trust in what?
相信什么?
Trust in what?
那就相信你自己的信赖吧
Well, how about trust in your own trustworthiness.
相信你想要过的自己的生活
Trust in your intention to live the life that's
尽你所能做到100%真实
yours to live, to be 100% authentic, as best you can.
信任是一种我们都具备的能力  就是感到自在
And trust is a capacity that we all have to actually be at home
让这一刻顺其自然
and allow this moment to be as it is,
让这一刻顺其自然
and allow this moment to be as it is,
让面前的事情变得值得信任  即使它很可怕
and to have it be trustworthy, even if it's scary.
这并不意味着 你要天真地走进
And so that doesn't mean that you're going to sort of naively
一个非常有害的环境中去
walk into very harmful situations
只因你要信任所有事情
because you're so trusting.
我是说  你得知道什么时候
I mean, you have to be aware of when
是时候不相信别人了  好吗
it's time not to be trusting, okay,
不过相信我刚才这句啊
and trust that.
所以把信任带入修习中就是
So to bring trust into the equation is to kind of really
在提醒我们自己
remind ourselves that, well, there's
有很多我们可以信任的东西
a lot that we can actually trust.
就像我们可以相信  我们的呼吸在体内穿梭
Like we can trust that our breath is moving in the body.
就目前而言  这是值得信赖的
That's, for now, trustworthy.
我们的脚将带着我们前行
That our feet will carry us,
我们的心将在夜晚继续跳动
that our heart will continue to beat through the night,
我们的眼睛能正常看到世界
that our eyes actually function.
所有这些我们从未想过的事情
All these things we never think about at all,
它们实际上可以提醒我们
but they actually can remind us of how much
在当下这个时刻发生的事情中  有多少是可信的
is going on in any particular moment that's really reliable,
是真正值得信赖的
that is really trustworthy.
最重要的是
And the most important element of this
你的心是否值得信赖
is whether your heart is trustworthy.
我知道唯一能让你的心值得信赖的方法
And the only way I know for your heart
让我的心值得信赖的方法
to be trustworthy, for my heart to be trustworthy
就是相信自己  相信自己值得信赖
is to trust myself, to trust that it could
即便我把注意力放在
be if I'm paying attention to all the ways
我可能会辜负自己或他人的信任的事情上
that I might betray my own trust or other people's trust.
你就可以看到正念会起作用
So you can see that mindfulness will function
在很多不同的层面上起作用  所以刚才说的这些
on a lot of different levels here so that these are not
不是我们一直在谈论的陈词滥调  什么信任别人
kind of cliches that we talk about, like how important it is
或者让自己值得相信非常重要
to be trusting or trustworthy, but they are really
信任是深刻的  象征洞察力的源泉
sources of deep, embodied insight
它包括  如何将内在与外在的经历发散开
about how to be in wise relationship
使其保持良好的关联
with experience unfolding, inwardly and outwardly.
当然  这就是正念的修习
And that, of course, is the practice of mindfulness,
这就是正念所传达的
what mindfulness is all about.
【不争】
这些因素中的另一个  就是 不争
Another of these factors is called non-striving.
当然  这从表面上听起来真的
And this is certainly one that on its face can sound really
有点反美  反对积极  反对追求结果
anti-American, anti-go-getter, anti-get-the-result.
因为不争  是需要认识到这种
Because non-striving really hinges around recognizing this
对现实深刻的  非双重的洞察
deep, non-dual insight about reality.
不争基本上  在我们当下的每时每刻
And that is that fundamentally in the unfolding
在冥想修习中  能够很好地展现
of our moments, and in the meditation
这也是我们当下呈现着的反映
practice as well, which is a reflection of the unfolding
反映出了  无处可去
of all our moments, that there is no place to go,
无事可做  无所追求
nothing to do, and nothing to attain.
但当你接受了这个观点  那瞬间
When you adopt that perspective, everything
一切都可以实现
is attainable, instantly.
所以这里有很多悖论
So there's plenty of paradox here.
这个悖论实际上就像一个潜在洞察力的漩涡
And that paradox is actually like a vortex
一种实现
of potential insight, of realization,
一种象征性的清晰感
of embodied clarity.
但它不能转化为思想
But it can't translate into thought.
而思考是永远无法把它引出来的
And thinking will never bring it to the fore.
所以不争与信任有很深的关系
So non-striving is really deeply related to trust,
这是在提醒你  不争可能会要你去做更多的事情——
that it's really a reminder that you can probably get more work done--
我有过很多次这样的经历
I've had this experience many times--
不依附于结果  不是拼命去做这件事情
and better work by not being attached to the outcome
然后做得更好了
and striving to get the thing done,
反倒是照顾好  尊重它
but to simply take care of it and honor
确保其中的每一部分
what's required to make sure every piece of it
都具有完整性
has integrity.
然后水到渠成
And it'll get done when it gets done.
当然了  我们必须面对现实  我们有DDL
Now, of course, we have to work with the real world, deadlines,
还有杂七杂八的事情
and everything else.
而把这件事带到你的意识之前
But just bringing that to the fore in your own consciousness
实际上可以帮助你更快地完成工作
actually can help you get things done a lot faster.
事实证明  不争很有效
It turns out that non-striving really
当你目标非常明确的时候  很有用
is useful when you're very, very goal oriented.
你可以在职业运动员身上看到这一点
And one way you can see that is in professional sports.
职业运动员已经开始将正念
And professional sports has taken
带入各种各样的运动中  与过去的10-15年中
to mindfulness in various sports, some more than others
更多的运动员开始正念修习  前所未有的多
over the past 10 or 15 years than ever before.
我们知道职业运动员都是目标非常明确的
And professional athletes are like incredibly goal oriented,
而且不只是目标导向
and more than goal oriented.
他们不只是想得分  或者投进一颗球
They don't just want to score goals or baskets.
他们是想赢  对吧
They want to win, okay?
所以可以说他们被胜利
So you could say they would be attached
深深吸引着
to the outcome of winning.
但他们也明白
But they also understand that when
当你太执着于胜利的结果的时候
you're too attached to the outcome of winning,
矛盾的是  即便你用自己的方式
paradoxically you can get in your own way
依然可能输掉比赛  因为心浮气躁
and lose the game, because the mind wasn't clear.
那么在球场上或者竞技场上的比分情况
And so what happens on the court or on the playing field also
可能会被瞬间扭转
can go south in a second.
如果迈克尔·乔丹  勒布朗·詹姆斯
So if Michael Jordan, LeBron James,
如果迈克尔·乔丹  勒布朗·詹姆斯
So if Michael Jordan, LeBron James,
斯蒂芬·库里可以修习正念——
and Steph Curry can practice mindfulness--
那我不知道这地球上  还有谁会比他们
and there aren't any more competitive people that I know
更强了
on the planet--
那也许我们应该重新考虑一下这个问题
then maybe we should rethink this whole question
嗯  不争  是把我们对胜利的渴望
about how, well, non-striving will like take the hunger out
剥离出来
of my desire to win.
这并不意味着你会成为一个消极的人
It doesn't mean that you become a passive person who
总是一事无成
never gets anything done.
我认识的很多人
I mean, I know thousands of people
他们都在各个领域有很高的成就
out there who are highly accomplished,
他们都在冥想
people in every domain of life who are all meditating.
没有人感觉到说  哦  冥想
And no one feels, oh, the meditation
削弱了我的能力
is taking the edge off of me.
恰恰相反  他们中的许多人会说
Quite the opposite, many of them will
这就是我竞争优势的来源
say that's where my competitive edge comes from.
我有了另一个重要的能量来源
I've got this other profound resource
如同一根输氧管把氧气
to tap into that's like an oxygen line
直接输入心脏
straight into the heart.
【接纳】
接纳是另一个态度因素
So acceptance is another one of these attitudinal factors.
让我们来思考一下接纳的问题
So let's think about acceptance for a moment.
接纳意味着  看到事物的现实
So acceptance really means seeing the actuality of things,
承认并接受它们就是这样的
and recognizing and accepting that they're like this.
接纳并不意味着你不能努力去改变他们
Acceptance doesn't mean you can't work to change them.
如果你  哦  那我就全盘接受了
If you, oh, I'm just going to accept
当一个谋杀的目击者  或其他形式的社会不公
being a witness to a murder, or social injustice of any kind,
接纳并不意味着  哦  这不关我的事
acceptance doesn't mean, oh, ho-hum, it's not my business,
没发生在我自己身上  不是我的家人
not me, not my family.
所以接纳并不意味着我就接受了
So acceptance doesn't mean like I just accept
一切原来的样子
everything the way it is.
接纳意味着看清现实
Acceptance means seeing clearly what the reality is
并让它在你的脑海中浮现
and letting it actually register with you.
然后你才接纳它
Okay, then you've accepted it, which
意味着你有时会意识到一些不可接受的事情
means you've recognized maybe the unacceptable at times.
然后问题是  我该如何
And then the question is, how am I
与这些不可容忍的事情  需要被改变的事情
going to be in wise relationship with what's intolerable,
保持明智的关系呢?
what needs to be changed?
所以这和消极的顺从 一点关系都没有
So it has nothing to do with passive resignation.
但很多人会把这两者混淆
But a lot of people confound the two,
他们会想  哦  大家讨论接纳的时候
and they think, oh, when they talk
他们所指的就是让你丢掉自尊
about acceptance they just mean like you give up your spine.
你只能消极地让自己屈服于这些力量
And you just passively resign yourself to these forces
屈服于这些比你强大而你却无能为力的力量
that are bigger than you and you can't do anything.
如果真是这样  人类就真的完蛋了
If that winds up being the case, humanity is really screwed.
好  此时此刻
Okay, that we need the exact opposite
我们所需要的正好相反
at this moment in time.
我们需要看到真实的现实
We need to see the actual reality
正在发生的一切  看到它的复杂性
of what's going on, in all its complexity and all
它的简洁性
its simplicity.
这就是接纳的部分  但不是放弃
And then that's the acceptance part, but no resignation
任何东西
whatsoever.
比如  我们是要看得清楚  然后开始行动
It's just clear seeing, and then action, acting,
为了防止出现伤害
coming out of apprehending harm being done, for instance,
要有立场  有原则的立场  有道德的立场
and taking a stand, a principled stand, an ethical stand.
所以接纳并不意味着消极的顺从
So acceptance does not mean passive resignation.
而它意味着  对事物的现状有深刻洞察的认识
But it means a deep insightful recognition of things as they are.
如果你是唯一一个看清这件事情走向的人
And if you are the only one that sees the way things are,
而其他人都说 是另外那样
and everybody else is saying it's some other way,
相信自己
trust yourself.
